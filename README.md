# laravel_web-scrapper
Content scraping means reading pieces of content from html or xml pages to be displayed in some websites or to be saved into database, for example we might want to read a listing of articles in a news website or to read the products of ecommerce websites to make something like pricing comparison, etc. So the process is to pull pieces of information like item titles, descriptions, images and more.
